## BYF (Before You Follow) Lists

- If I ever said something problematic, inappropriate, or weird in general, feel free to DM about my actions
- I often use vulgar words with people I consider that I am close with, unless in professional conversation.
- I am not a minor, so if you are not comfortable with interacting or following someone who is an adult, please do not interact or follow.
- I prefer not to interact with people who were born in 2009 or later, unless we are currently mutuals.

### Instagram specific lists
