## Who's Han Senni, actually?

I'm Senni! The phrase that could describe me the best is "Linux-obsessed audiophile photographer motorcyclist". I started my programming, motorcycling, and photography career in 2021 (when I was 15), along with my Linux journey. I later started my audiophile journey in 2022. 

I am mainly in Sky: Children of the Light and Project Sekai fandom, though I also play other video games such as Half-Life series, Left 4 Dead 2, Project Diva series, Gran Turismo Series, GRID Legends, and Ride: Game.

I also take photographs (mainly landscape and street photography), with my following camera gear :

- Canon EOS 60D 
- Canon EF50mm f/1.8 STM
- Canon EF-S18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS
- Canon EF75-300mm f/4-5.6 III

and I have been posting and selling my photos on my [Shutterstock account](https://shutterstock.com/g/senni_han), with plans to sell my printed photos in near future.

## What I have done and contributed.

In my Linux journey, I have contributed to translation for Ubuntu, and I used to contributed for translation for Vanilla OS. I have a [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@senni_ride_audio) for my motorcycling career. I am fairly active in tech communities, giving supports and advices for newcomers.

I know Git, Python, Bash, Markdown and a little bit of Java, HTML/CSS/JS, and C.

I joined several boot camp related to computer engineering, coding, robotics, and design thinking, in which I contributed to the camp, and collaborate well with the team.
