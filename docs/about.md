## Who's Senni, actually?

I'm Senni! The phrase that could describe me the best is "Linux-obsessed audiophile photographer motorcyclist". I started my programming, motorcycling, and photography career in 2021 (when I was 15), along with my Linux journey. I later started my audiophile journey in 2022. 

I am mainly in Honkai: Star Rail and Project Sekai fandom, though I also play other video games such as Sky: COTL, Tetris, Half-Life series, Left 4 Dead 2, Project Diva series, Gran Turismo Series, GRID Series, and RIDE 2

I also take photographs (mainly landscape and street photography), with my following camera gear :

- Canon EOS 60D 
- Canon EF50mm f/1.8 STM
- Canon EF-S18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS
- Canon EF75-300mm f/4-5.6 III
- Fujica GP

and I have been posting and selling my photos on my [Shutterstock account](https://shutterstock.com/g/senni_han), with plans to sell my printed photos in near future.

## What I have done and contributed.

I have experiences in video games and software development, coding, Linux, and art. In my Linux journey, I have contributed to translation for Ubuntu, and I used to contributed for translation for Vanilla OS. I am fairly active in tech communities, giving supports and advices for people in the communities.

I have graduated Year 3 of Territorial Defense Student program, earning an acting sergeant rank, and have passed the program's training in riflemanship.

I also have a [Youtube Channel](https://youtube.com/@senni_ride_audio) for my motorcycling hobby, and an [Instagram Account](https://instagram.com/senni_photos) for my photography hobby, and occasional hired photoshoots.

I am great with Git, Linux, HTML/CSS/JS, Python, Arduino, Markdown, and Bash, and I am currently learning C, Rust, and Swift.

I joined several boot camp related to computer engineering, coding, robotics, and design thinking, in which I contributed to the camp, and collaborate well with the team.

In my free time, I enjoy photography, in which I have learned artistic design and creativity, attention to details, management, and communication with clients, and I also enjoy motorcycling, and listening to Hi-Fi music.
